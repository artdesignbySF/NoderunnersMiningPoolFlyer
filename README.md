How to: Set Up your Bitaxe:
Connect your Bitaxe to the power supply and wait a moment for it to boot.

Start your web browser and open the IP adress shown on the screen of the Bitaxe.

Head over to settings on the top left of the screen.

Enter your wifi data.

In the field "stratum URL" you put in "pool.noderunners.network" and in the
field "stratum port" you type in "1337".

The stratum user is filled with the bitcoin address you want the rewards to be sent to. Additionally you can add a dedicated worker name by adding a "." after your bitcoin address followed by the worker name.

Save the settings and restart your Bitaxe.
